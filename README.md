# Bank_Defaults
Bank default prediction using Support Vector Classifier with an optimal threshold of under-sampling and over-sampling (using SMOTE) to handle the highly 
imbalanced dataset. The project also focuses on the choice of metric while handling an imbalanced dataset, feature cleaning and feature scaling since SVC has 
been used which can be affected by large values in the variable like the 'salary'. 

Data Description:
The dataset has 23 features with 1500 entries in the training set. It contains the demographic details of the customer, salary, account information etc.
